   --n : First Subtracts then passes n into the function 
2] Whenever you are asked to solve something, digit by digit then use remainder(% last ) and quotient(/ lastout )
3] The pattern of taking some elements and removing some elements is known as susbset pattern, Then number of subsets exists of string of length n is 2^n
4] If total length of string is n then its permutation which will exists are n!
